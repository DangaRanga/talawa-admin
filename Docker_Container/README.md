## Steps to start the build with Docker

### Project Setup

- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

- Build and Tag The Docker Image

`$ docker build -t sample:dev`

- Then Spin up the container once build is done

```
$ docker run \
    -it \
    --rm \
    -v ${PWD}:/app \
    -v /app/node_modules \
    -p 3001:3000 \
    -e CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true \
    sample:dev
```

- Whats Happening here

1. The `docker run` command creates and runs a new conatiner instance from the image we just created

2. `-it` starts the container in interactive mode

3. `--rm` removes the container and volumes after the container exists.

4. `-v ${PWD}:/app` mounts the code into the container at "/app".

5. Since we want to use the container version of the “node_modules” folder, we configured another volume: `-v /app/node_modules` . You should now be able to remove the local “node_modules” flavor.

6. `-p 3001:3000` exposes port 3000 to other Docker containers on the same network (for inter-container communication) and port 3001 to the host.

7. Finally , `-e CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true` enables a polling mechanism via chokidar (which wraps `fs.watch`, `fs.watchFile`, and `fsevents`) so that hot-reloading will work.

### For using compose file

- Build the image and fire up the container

`$ docker-compose up -d --build`

- Ensure the app is running in the browser and test hot - reloading again. Bring down the container before moving on

`$ docker-compose stop`

- Now your container is ready to run
